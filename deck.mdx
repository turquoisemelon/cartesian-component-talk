## What is a design system?
## 🤔

<Notes>
  To start with, briefly touch on what a design system is. 
  Ask if anyone heard of Design Systems before
  Ask if there Are there anyone who worked in a ds project before
</Notes>

import { ImageContainer } from './components/ImageContainer'
import { DS } from './components/DS'

<ImageContainer src='./images/ds.jpeg' width='100%' />

<Notes>
  Systematic approach to product development. 
  Tools, guidelines, shared principles and code
  Enables teams to work more efficiently and build consistent products in collaboration rather than in silos.
  A single source of truth for all of the product teams
  Material Design by Google.
  Companies like AirBnb, Shopify, Github, IBM also have their own design systems.

<Notes>
  Design system typically has different parts to it. 
  A shared design language which includes like brand colors, typography, spacing scale etc. 
  Design kit: assets for designers to use
  Component library is where you have all your component code
  Developer Sandbox is used to display, test and validate your components in isolation with their different variations without having to build entire pages
  Documentation piece is as the name suggest the place where you document your design system and usage guidelines

## Component Variation
## Rendering

<Notes>
  Tie Ds to component variation rendering
  Now that we've covered Design system specifics, you might be wondering how does component variation relates to all of that.

  Recap on what a component library is.
  Tie that to component variation rendering?
  Why is it important?
  As I previously mentioned component library in a design system includes all of your components like button, input field, checkbox etc.
  In the process of building a component library, you'd want to visualize how the growing number of components look in their different states and variations in the dev environment.
  This HElps building bug free and high quality UI 
  Helps with testing

  Talk about button component's different variations, different props it takes in
  Normally Manual rendering, Go to the next slide to show that in code. Mention disadvantages

  This can quickly get out of hand. There’s probably a big maintenance overhead associated with writing all the components manually, too. 
  What happens if you have to update a prop? You'd need to update every instance manually. 
  Sounds tedious. What if there’s a way to achieve the same result faster and by writing less code?

  A French mathematician named Rene Descartes comes to our rescue all the way from the 16. century!
  He developed Cartesian coordinate system that gave rise to the Cartesian product concept which eventually gave rise to the Cartesian component.

## Cartesian Product
<ImageContainer src='./images/cartesian-products.jpg' width='100%' />

<Notes>
  In the context of Math, Cartesian product is a mathematical operation that returns a product from multiple sets. 
  The cartesian product of two sets A and B here is equal to the set of all possible combinations of values from both sets.
  This all we need to know to understand Cartesian component magic.
</Notes>

## Cartesian Component
## 📐

<Notes>
  It uses the same concept to generate and render the component for every possible combination of its properties that are passed in. 
  This way you'd get your component displayed in its different variations without having to manually write it once for every possible combination of its props values.

  ]}

<Notes>
  Let’s see how that looks in the case of our Button component.
  Cartesian component takes in Button component and its props values as arrays and renders the component for every combination of these different property values. 
  It achieves this by taking cartesian product of prop arrays under the hood.
  Reduces the lines of codes, makes it so easy to update any prop value
  One cool thing about using cartesian component is that: It shows you all the combinations of the props even the ones that you might not thinking to combine if you were to write them manually
  Another feature we added to our evrsion of the cartesian component is that it lets you pass in a container that'll get wrapped around every rendered component.
  Here, the container adds a list of props and their values for every variation of the component.

![adding new prop to the cartesian component](https://cl.ly/d3b88ebaa62d/Screen%252520Recording%2525202019-05-08%252520at%25252002.44%252520PM.gif)

<Notes>
  I've recorded this quick gif to demonstrate how easy it is to render the new component variations when a new prop is introduced
  Let’s say I want to see how my buttons look when they are in the disabled state:
  All I need to do is to add that prop to the button cartesian component along with the values I want it to take.
  And then, boom I see how my button looks in disabled state in combination with other prop values

<Notes>
  Cartesian component has made component variation rendering a lot easier for us.
  It has improved our component development work flow by saving us lots of time and lines of code. 
  It has also saved us from all the burden and maintenance overhead that potentially comes with manual work.
  This way we've been able to better focus on building right UI that fulfills all the project requirements. 

  I just wanted show you this art work by teammate Russell to show you how Descart and Cartesian is a huge part of my team's culture at this point. 
  We absolutely love it and I definitely recommend you to check it out as well
