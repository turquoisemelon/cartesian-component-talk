# What is a design system?
# ü§î

<Notes>
  To start with, briefly touch on what a design system is. 
  Ask if anyone heard of Design Systems before
  Ask if there Are there anyone who worked in a ds project before

<Notes>
  Systematic approach to product development. 
  Tools, guidelines, shared principles and code
  Enables teams to work more efficiently and build consistent products in collaboration rather than in silos.
  A single source of truth for all of the product teams.

<Notes>
  Design system typically has different parts to it. 
  Design language represents the overall visual design of a digital product.
  This defines characteristics such as typography, colors, icons, spacing and so on. It is maintained as Design Tokens in code. 
  Design kit: A library of shared styles, symbols or components that can be used by product teams to design or prototype new experiences. Symbols maps to JavaScript components from the component library. The mapping might not always be a direct one but they always need to be kept in sync.
  Component library is a set of JavaScript components that are version controlled and can be composed to build
  applications and products.
  Developer Sandbox: a tool for Design system developers. Is used to develop components in isolation,
  document use cases and write tests  without having to run the entire application.
  Documentation: guidelines on how to consume the Design System, design language, design and dev 
  considerations and detailed documentation for each component.

# Component Variation
# Rendering

<Notes>
  Tie Ds to component variation rendering
  Now that we've covered Design system specifics, you might be wondering how does component variation relates to all of that.
</Notes>

<Notes>
  Zooming into component library.
  It includes all of the components like buttons input fields etc
  In the process of building a component library, you'd want to visualize how the growing number of components look in their different states and variations in the dev environment.
  This HElps developers building high quality UI that meets the requirements
  Helps with testing

  Talk about button component's different variations, different props it takes in
  Normally Manual rendering, Go to the next slide to show that in code

<Notes>
  This can quickly get out of hand. There‚Äôs probably a big maintenance overhead associated with writing all the components manually, too. 
  What happens if you have to update a prop? You'd need to update every instance manually. 
  Sounds tedious. What if there‚Äôs a way to achieve the same result faster and by writing less code?

### Ren√© Descartes

<Notes>
  A French mathematician named Rene Descartes comes to our rescue all the way from the 16. century!
  He developed Cartesian product concept.
</Notes>

## Cartesian Product
<ImageContainer src='./images/cartesian-product.png' width='100%' />

<Notes>
  In the context of Math, Cartesian product is an operation that returns a product from multiple sets.
  The end result will include every possible combination of the values that exist within each set.
</Notes>
---
<ImageContainer src='./images/props-cartesian-product.png' width='100%' />

<Notes>
  Apply the same concept to the component props.
</Notes>

# Cartesian Component
# üìê

<Notes>
  It uses the same concept to generate and render the component for every possible combination of its properties that are passed in. 
  This way you'd get your component displayed in its different variations without having to manually write it once for every possible combination of its props values.
</Notes>

  code={require("!raw-loader!./ButtonCartesian.js").default}
  theme={duotoneDark}
  lang="javascript"
  size="large"
  showNumbers={false}

  steps={[
    {}, // First step should be an overview of the snippet
    { range: [3, 10] },
    { lines: [5], },
    { lines: [6], },
    { range: [7, 10] },
    { lines: [4], },
  ]}
/>

<Notes>
  Let‚Äôs see how that looks in the case of our Button component.
  Cartesian component takes in Button component and its props values as arrays and renders the component for every combination of these different property values. 
  It achieves this by taking cartesian product of prop arrays under the hood.
  Reduces the lines of codes, makes it so easy to update any prop value.
  One cool thing about using cartesian component is that: It shows you all the combinations of the props even the ones that you might not thinking to combine if you were to write them manually
  Mention about the container that'll get wrapped around every rendered component.
  Here, the container adds a list of props and their values for every variation of the component.

![adding new prop to the cartesian component](https://cl.ly/d3b88ebaa62d/Screen%252520Recording%2525202019-05-08%252520at%25252002.44%252520PM.gif)

<Notes>
  I've recorded this quick gif to demonstrate how easy it is to render the new component variations when a new prop is introduced
  Let‚Äôs say I want to see how my buttons look when they are in the disabled state:
  All I need to do is to add that prop to the button cartesian component along with the values I want it to take.
  And then, boom I see how my button looks in disabled state in combination with other prop values
